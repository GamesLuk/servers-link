# Server Groups Configuration
# This file defines server groups and their synchronization settings
# Groups allow multiple servers to share specific features like chat, player data, etc.

groups:
    # Global group - applies to all servers by default
    global:
        chat: true              # Synchronize chat messages across all servers in this group
        player_data: false      # Do not sync player inventory, health, etc. globally
        player_list: true       # Show players from all servers in this group in the player list (TAB)
        roles: false            # Do not sync player roles/permissions globally
        whitelist: true         # Share whitelist across all servers in this group

    # Survival servers group - for survival game mode servers
    survival:
      # chat: true            # Inherits from global if not specified
      player_data: true         # Sync player inventory, health, etc. between survival servers
      # player_list: true     # Inherits from global if not specified
      roles: true               # Sync player roles/permissions between survival servers
      # whitelist: true       # Inherits from global if not specified

    # Creative servers group - for creative game mode servers
    creative:
      # chat: true            # Inherits from global if not specified
      player_data: true         # Sync player inventory, health, etc. between creative servers
      # player_list: true     # Inherits from global if not specified
      roles: true               # Sync player roles/permissions between creative servers
      # whitelist: true       # Inherits from global if not specified

# Custom rules - allows defining specific synchronization rules for combinations of groups
rules:
    # Example rule (currently disabled):
    # 0:
    #  groups: ["survival", "creative"]    # Apply this rule to these specific groups
    #  chat: true                          # Override chat sync setting for this combination
    #  player_data: false                  # Override player data sync for this combination
    #  player_list: true                   # Override player list sync for this combination
    #  roles: false                        # Override roles sync for this combination
    #  whitelist: true                     # Override whitelist sync for this combination
